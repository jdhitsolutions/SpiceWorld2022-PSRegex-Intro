# Unlocking the Power of Regular Expressions with PowerShell

The items in this repository include my presentation and demonstration materials for my session on getting started with regular expressions and PowerShell. The session was part of [Spiceworld 2022](https://www.spiceworks.com/spiceworld/).

## Abstract

_Using regular expressions is a skill every IT Pro should have in their toolbox. But many people don't know where to start or why it even matters. In this session, long-time PowerShell teacher Jeff Hicks will introduce you to regular expression fundamentals and demonstrate how to take advantage of them in PowerShell._
